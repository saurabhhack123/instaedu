		<h1>About DevGeek T-Shirts.</h1>
		<p>DevGeek T-shirts was an idea conceived after modest success on Kickstarter with a single t-shirt called The Super Geek Tee. After realizing there was an underserved <br> market for developer themed t-shirts, I came up with a handful of design concepts, elicited help from a good friend to film a video, and launched DevGeek T-shirts on <br>Kickstarter in April, 2013. About a month later, 469 backers made DevGeek T-shirts a success</p>
		<h3>Have a shirt idea?</h3>
		<p>Sometimes people tell us they have a great idea for a shirt. Is that you? Then open an issue on our shirt-ideas repo on GitHub and tell us about it!</p>

			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
